This is a short story-telling game, in which you draw tarot cards in sequence along with a 12-point version of Campbell's Hero's Journey.

To play, click on the facedown cards. You will be presented with a text prompt - a question about your character, or information about this point of the Hero's Journey. You may answer it, but you aren't required to - a text area is provided for you to save notes if you want.

It is not required to create a character when playing through a journey, but it is advised - it may help you answer some questions about how to interpret the card you draw for a story point. The best way to play may be to draw and/or answer the 4 cards in the Character section, from the top to the bottom, and then go from point 1 to point 2 to point 3... to point 12 in the Journey circle.

You can save and load both characters and journeys. Loading a new character will clear the current journey, regardless of if it is saved! Loading a new journey will not clear your current character - one character may go on many journeys.

## Future updates
 
- add element to each card description/meaning
- Make it so duplicate cards can't be drawn
- Make it so each point can have up to 2 cards - you can draw another to provide additional context for the first
- Display character point text next to card thumbnail
- At the end of journey, display in a modal window all the text entered for your journey and character

## Thanks

- Thanks to Aeclectic, Biddy Tarot, and Labyrinthos for their helpful card meanings and descriptions.
  - Card descriptions were written by smashing their versions together. Card meanings are my own but strongly informed by these sources.

- Thanks to Holly Gonzalez on Wattpad for the descriptions of the stages of the Hero's Journey.
  - While looking for descriptions of the stages, I found, unsurprisingly, that others had had the idea to make a tarot spread of the Hero's Journey as well.

- Thanks to Sasha Reneau, designing the Spindlewheel deck and games - this project was heavily inspired by them and I hope to play them some day soon!
