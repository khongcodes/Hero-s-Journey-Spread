Thanks to Aeclectic, Biddy Tarot, and Labyrinthos for tarot card meanings and descriptions
Thanks to Muzendo for high quality images.
Thanks to Holly Gonzalez on Wattpad for the descriptions of the stages of the Hero's Journey - while looking for descriptions of the stages, I found, unsurprisingly, that others had had the idea to make a tarot spread of the Hero's Journey as well.
