    info: "The story begins with the character in their usual routine, unaware of the adventures about to unfold. This is a kind of safe place, or 'comfort zone', which they may or may not want to change. The protagonist's everyday life and routines are presented in a way which endears them to us, and makes us sympathize with their plight. In this stage, we learn important details about our hero, their outlook and personality, backstory, and what they're capable of."

    title: "2. The Call To Adventure",
    info: "This is the scene or event which begins the adventure. A call to action, jolting the character out of the familiar, and urging them to undertake the quest. It usually disrupts their peace somehow, threatening what thy know and love, though it doesn't always have to be a traumatic or violent event. Sometimes it comes in the form of a message, a conversation, a chance meeting, or a nagging liability they've tried to avoid thus far. Either way, the Ordinary World is about to change, and the character must do something about it, whether they like it or not."
